The files contained in this folder are for use in testing our AJAX library. Some examples may rely on these running.

They are just simple nodeJS scripts. They don't require any external dependancies other than nodeJS.

To run, simply go "node <filename>" and it'll run. The port numbers are coded into the examples, but if there are collisions,
use --port=<port> as a argument, and modify the example appropriately.
