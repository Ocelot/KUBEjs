            var Response = _ResponseDef();

            //Response is all about setting relevant data to be returned to the originating request scope. Setting tends to be done by the Client, or target RequestHandler

            //SetResponseType: This isn't checked for validity. It is expected to be set if relevant by the Client (which should indicate some preprocessing on the data has occurred)
            Response.SetResponseType('json');

            //GetResponseType: Again, response type doesn't actually force anything. It's primarily to maintain communication consistency between expected Request and Response
            console.log('ResponseType: '+Response.GetResponseType());

            //SetStatusCode/Text: XHR splits Status between Code and Text. This is reflected here and is generally handled by Client (for Remote)
            Response.SetStatusCode(200);
            Response.SetStatusText('OK');

            //SetHeaders: This takes an object type and overwrites the headerObj. For XHR client parses the Header text into a proper object before setting
            Response.SetHeaders({'X-Header':1});

            //AddHeader: _key, _val gets added to the header Obj
            Response.AddHeader('X-Header2',1);

            /*
             * This is a fairly pointless example of Response, but it is the Object passed into the promise returned from a
             * successful Client.SendRequest() so knowing the API is important. Also in the case that the Request was actually
             * routed locally, this object can be built manually to satisfy the Client.
