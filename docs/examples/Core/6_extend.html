    <title>KUBEjs Core: KUBE.Extend</title>
    <!-- Include KUBE.js -->

    <!-- KUBE.Extend is a special function of KUBE that allows us to extend native types without cluttering tons of overhead, or additional garbage -->
    <script type="text/javascript">

        //KUBE Extend has the same deferred loading methodology as other KUBE Classes, but the result is a bit different. Let's look at binding something to an Object

        //First we scope (as always) - Also this should really be in its own file, because it won't want to be 'used' in its own file due to race conditions
        (function(KUBE){
            "use strict";

            //Now when our 'file' is called, we want to use KUBE.SetAsLoaded() this is step 1 in the KUBE AutoLoader knowing the namespace is loaded and safe
            KUBE.SetAsLoaded('/KUBE/Examples/Extend/Object');

            //Now we get the ExtendAPI
            var ExtendAPI = KUBE.Extend();

            //We have three arguments, the native type we are extending, the name of the method that will be attached, and the function callback itself
            ExtendAPI.Load('object','log',Log);

            function Log(){
                //Now this will become accessible through {}.KUBE().log(). KUBE as a function is already bound to every native type. When called, that's when it uses the Extend registry to bind available functions
                //Inside the function this === the native reference itself
                //ie.
                console.log(this);
            }

            //Now that we know everything is available, we do the 2nd part of making sure KUBE AutoLoader knows our namespace has loaded, which is EmitState
            KUBE.EmitState('/KUBE/Examples/Extend/Object');
        }(KUBE));

        //Extend libraries don't actually result in a callable reference. This is why you see them bound in 'uses' but never used
        //Instead we access them through the native KUBE() method, as seen here
        var obj = {'this':'is','a':'object'};
        obj.KUBE().log();

        //API reference for the /Library/Extend functionality can be seen in the Extend section of examples (when it exists)
