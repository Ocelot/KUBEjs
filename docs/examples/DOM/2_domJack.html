             * It provides:
             *  -Attribute Handling
             *  -Node Management
             *  -Relationship Management
             *  -Event Abstraction
             *  -Content Management
             *  -General Information
             *  -Utilities
             *  -Class Management (with an additional inline Style abstraction)
             *  -Element Mutation APIs
             *
